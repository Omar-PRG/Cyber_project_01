# Cyber_project_01
In this project i will encypt then decrypt files
We generate the code then we save it in binary format in 'filename' depends on our file name.


In summary, the code generates an encryption key, saves it to a file, encrypts files in a specified directory, and then decrypts the encrypted files back to their original state.

GenerateKey->Savekey->load-key->encrypt_file depending on the file path we provide->decrypt the files in the same directory :DDDDDD
